            My name is Qianqian Li, but you can also call me Laura. I am a junior from University of Rochester double majoring in computer science and digital media studies.
            I am very interested in web design, software design, and AR/VR techniques and have some programming skills in Java, HTML, SQL, and so on.
            I am also eager to learn to use my coding skills to create and to make changes.
            Nice to meet you!
